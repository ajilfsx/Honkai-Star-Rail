					<p class="storytext "> <span class="colortext">Prologue: Herta Space Station</span> - The Herta Space Station is attacked by members of the Antimatter Legion, followers of the Path of Destruction. Amidst the chaos, two Stellaron Hunters, Kafka and Silver Wolf, infiltrate the station and steal the Stellaron that was being safely held within it. Kafka takes hold of the Stellaron and inserts it into the body of an empty vessel generated by Silver Wolf (whose gender and name are chosen by the player). The vessel (known as the Trailblazer in English and various other names in other translations of the game) awakens, after which Kafka erases their memory, informs them of the future that lies ahead and leaves. They then fall unconscious. A now-amnesic Trailblazer wakes up and meets March 7th and Dan Heng. Both are traveling on the Astral Express, a large cosmic train that travels the universe along the eponymous "Star Rail". After eliminating the remaining threats from the Antimatter Legion, the Trailblazer meets Himeko, the Navigator of the Astral Express, and Welt Yang, an interstellar traveler originating from the world of Honkai Impact 3rd. In an attempt to discover their origins and eliminate the threats of the remaining Stellarons, the Trailblazer departs with the Astral Express crew. <br> <br>
					<span class="colortext">Crown of the Mundane and Divine</span> - Ruan Mei, a member of the Genius Society, asks the Trailblazer to clean up lifeforms accidentally created in a secluded zone of the Herta Space Station. Afterward, Dr. Ratio reveals that Ruan Mei cloned Skaracabaz, an Emanator of the Path of Propagation, which could destroy the station. The Trailblazer defeats Skaracabaz but returns to find Herta missing after an attack. Investigating, they uncover clues about Herta's disappearance and missing researchers. The Annihilation Gang, followers of the Path of Destruction, claim responsibility. The Trailblazer and Dr. Ratio defeat the gang members, rescue the researchers, and find Herta, resolving the crisis.</p>

				<div class="box2">
				<p class="storytext"> <span class="colortext">Chapter I: Jarilo-VI</span> - The Trailblazer, March 7th, and Dan Heng arrive at Jarilo-VI. This planet has been mostly ravaged by the Eternal Freeze, an uninhabitable winter caused by the power of a Stellaron, and the Fragmentum. This phenomenon creates powerful monsters that work to injure or kill humans and destroy human-made creations. As the crew nears the capital city of Belobog to resolve the Stellaron affair, they are branded as fugitives by Supreme Guardian Cocolia, after the Stellaron tells her to accuse them of attempting to overthrow Belobog's government. They escape from the Belobog's Silvermane Guards and move to the Underworld below the planet, where they learn of the peacekeeping Wildfire led by Seele and their ongoing conflict with Svarog, the leader of the robots, who has repeatedly rejected peace talks. After battling Svarog and learning new intelligence about the Stellaron, the crew returns to the surface to face Cocolia, who merges herself with the Stellaron and attempts to kill the Astral Express crew. The crew defeats her, and Bronya, Cocolia's adopted daughter, takes her place as the new Supreme Guardian while announcing plans to bridge the Underworld and Belobog together. <br> <br>
				<span class="colortext">Jolted Awake From a Winter Dream</span> - March 7th and the Trailblazer are invited by Bronya to the Solwarm festival in Belobog, where they discover that Topaz from the Interastral Peace Corporation (IPC) is trying to collect an expensive debt from hundreds of years ago. After failed negotiations, IPC workers invade the Underworld but are defeated by the Trailblazer and March 7th. Bronya considers letting the IPC take over Belobog but changes her mind after Himeko warns her of the IPC's poor track record. The Trailblazer and March 7th start to fight with Topaz but stop after an intervention from Bronya. After being shown the progress of Belobog's citizens in reconstructing their planet, Topaz leaves the planet and is demoted for her failure.</p>

					<p class="storytext"> <span class="colortext">Chapter II: The Xianzhou Luofu</span> - The crew receives a signal from Kafka, who wants the crew to settle a Stellaron incident on the Xianzhou Luofu, a planet following the Path of the Hunt. When Welt, the Trailblazer, and March 7th arrive, they are not permitted to assist in Stellaron affairs but are instead tasked by Jing Yuan, the general of the Xianzhou Luofu army, to weed out Kafka and her Stellaron Hunter cohort Blade, as the presence of the Stellaron Hunters on the ship is deemed a threat. The crew finds and defeats Kafka in battle, after which she reveals she was sent to lure the Astral Express crew to the Luofu to fulfill the prophecy laid out by the Stellaron Hunters' leader, Elio. <br> <br> After Blade and Kafka are found and interrogated, the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus, a faction following the Path of Abundance, a rival to Path of the Hunt, attack the Luofu in a conflict manipulated by Lord Ravager Phantylia, a leader of the Antimatter Legion. During this conflict, Dan Heng reveals that he is the reincarnation of a powerful exiled Vidyadhara criminal named Dan Feng during a battle with Blade, and assists the rest of the Astral Express and the Xianzhou Luofu army in fighting the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus and defeat Phantylia, resulting in the temporary retreat of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus and Antimatter Legion. After the battle, Jing Yuan formally creates an alliance between the Xianzhou and Astral Express and annuls the exile of Dan Heng's previous incarnation, granting him freedom onboard the Xianzhou Luofu. As a symbol of their alliance, Jing Yuan gifts the Astral Express a Jade Abacus that can be used to summon Xianzhou reinforcements in a time of need.

At Fyxestroll Garden, they meet members of the Ten-Lords Commission who warn them of the danger. Guinaifen disappears, and the Trailblazer gets trapped in a mirror by Cirrus, a heliobus. After defeating Furynox, Cirrus tries to take over the garden but is forced to retreat. The group then gathers escaped heliobi and rescues Huohuo, who was possessed.

As the Wardance approaches, several borisins disguised as foxians infiltrate the Shackling Prison and spring their leader free, the seemingly invulnerable Hoolay.

					<p class="storytext"> <span class="colortext">Chapter III: Penacony</span> - The Astral Express arrives on Penacony for the Charmony Festival, overseen by Sunday and his sister Robin. Penacony's luxury is the Dreamscape, a system of collective dreams. In the lead-up to the festival, they uncover the dark reality of the Dreamscape and face off against the monster called "Death", leading to Firefly's apparent death. After Robin is found murdered by "Death", Aventurine's betrayal, and subsequent confrontation with a Galaxy Ranger, Acheron reveals deeper conspiracies involving the Stellaron and the Family's control over the Dreamscape. Later when confronted with Sunday, Aventurine is caught swapping his Cornerstone (his source of power) with Topaz's and, in retaliation, Sunday uses his power to number Aventurine's hours. Plagued by visions of his past and future, Aventurine remembers he planned to get caught to lure Acheron and the Trailblazer. He reveals the Cornerstone belongs to his superior, Jade, and that he destroyed his own before arriving on Penacony. Aventurine then threatens to detonate the Stellaron within the Trailblazer, provoking Acheron to "kill" him. <br>
					A member of the Stellaron Hunters, Sam, revealed to be a surviving Firefly, explains to the Trailblazer and the Astral Express crew that "death" in the Dreamscape leads to the Land of the Exiles, guarded by Penacony's Head of Security, Gallagher. Gallagher "kills" Sunday, who reunites with Robin in the Land of the Exiles and reveals the Dreamscape is a Stellaron disaster controlled by the Family. Sunday realizes the Stellaron is at the Penacony Grand Theater and that the Dreammaster is involved. However, Sunday allies himself with the Dreammaster and betrays Welt and Robin, revealing their power comes from Order, and plans to use the Stellaron and Harmony's song to brainwash Penacony's inhabitants. The group learns of the Nameless' role in Penacony's liberation and, with Mikhail's help, the Trailblazer connects with Harmony. They confront Sunday at the Grand Theater, seemingly defeating him with Dan Heng's aid, but Black Swan reveals it was an illusion. With help from Acheron, Black Swan, Robin, and Galaxy Ranger Boothill, the Astral Express crew escapes the illusion and truly defeats Sunday, restoring the Dreamscape and reality.

					<p class="storytext"> <span class="colortext">Chapter III: Penacony (Last)</span> - To cover up the incident, the Charmony Festival is rebranded as a smaller event on the Radiant Feldspar airship. Oti Alfalfa, the new leader of the Family, initially plans an IPO for Penacony but relents after Jade threatens to reveal that true death is now possible in the Dreamscape. The IPC becomes a significant shareholder with 30% equity, gifting 5% to the Nameless. During the festival, Sparkle's bomb threat turns out to be a fireworks display. The Astral Express honors Mikhail, Gallagher, and the former Nameless, and the Trailblazer bids farewell to Acheron. As the Express prepares to depart, Welt explains the fuel issue, and Black Swan suggests heading to Amphoreus, the Eternal Land. Meanwhile, Jade offers Sunday a deal to fulfill his and Robin's vow to create a true haven of peace. <br> <br>
					<span class="colortext">Banana Outrage: Battles Without Ninja and Humanity</span> - The Astral Express is invited back to Penacony as Welt and Himeko are scheduled to give a guest lecture at Paperfold University and invite the other crewmembers as guest students to visit the campus for a week. Shortly after re-entering the Dreamscape, the Trailblazer finds themselves in a bizarre situation where everyone is obsessed with "Slumbernana Monkey," transforming everything they can into bananas and cartoon monkeys. The Trailblazer soon finds out that Slumbernana Monkey is a memetic virus, created by Dr. Primitive, that has taken hold at the school and will spread until everyone on Penacony is transformed into monkeys. With the help of the eccentric "Dazzling Ninja" Rappa, a returning Boothill, and famous film director-turned Memokeeper Mr. Reca, the Trailblazer defeats "Profnana", the mastermind behind the spread of the virus and reverts the Dreamscape to its previous state.
